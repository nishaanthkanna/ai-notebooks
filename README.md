People say doing a stuff for 10,000 hours makes you an expert in it. This is my 10,000 hours. 

# Plan Change

1. Convert existing to tensorflow and proceed in tensorflow and pytorch
2. Do RNN for sent analysis on Imdb only, rest in transformers

# Models to Learn:

RNN-GRU-LSTM
Sequence-to-sequence
Attention Mechanism
Transformers
Gato
